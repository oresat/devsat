Getting Started with ChiBIOS and STM32

I used Ubuntu with the STM32F0 devboard , but it should be similar for the F4.

Clone "devsat" repo
- sudo git clone https://github.com/oresat/devsat.git

Install OpenOCD
- sudo apt install openocd

Install GCC
- sudo apt git install gcc

Get ChiBIOS submodules in Git repo. (Miles had a different solution to this problem, but this is what worked for me)

- cd ./devsat/
- git submodule update --init

Install ARM GCC 

- sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi

Check that STM32 USB is showing up. You should see something like "Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0483:374b STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2.1 (Nucleo-F103RB)'

- lsusb

Program STM32

- cd ./devsat/firmware/chib_stf0x/src/app_blinky
- make write

Your should see something like:

** Verified OK **
** Resetting Target **


Yay! You have now successfully programmed the STM32. If You want change the blink rate, change the line:

"chThdSleepMilliseconds(100);"


--Install minicom for debugging

- sudo apt install minicom

open minicom

- sudo minicom

Setup minicom port

>CTRL-A Z //open help
>o //configuration optioon
>Serial port setup 
>Serial Device : /dev/ttyACM0 //Where I put /dev/ttyACM0, put your serial port
>Save setup as dfl
>CTRL-A Z X //exit with reset

reopen minicom
- sudo minicom

Notes:
- I was running on a virtual machine and I had to forward the USB port to the virtual machine.
